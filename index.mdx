TRTL3 born from a idea to let the storage easier to use for new developers. Designed entirely for beginner developers who want to learn how object storage works in practice, and build apps end to end ‚Äî without the complexity of cloud services or external dependencies.

If you're building or experimenting with file uploads, downloads, and basic file organization via HTTP ‚Äî TRTL3 is a great starting point!

So just try it!
