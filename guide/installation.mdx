## Requirements

To use TRTL3 you will need Docker installed first. If you dont have it you can install by following the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/)

If you want to have a docker-compose file you will need Docker compose installed, you can also install it by [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/)

Then you can go to installation guide.

## Install

After Install Docker you can install TRTL3 using this command:

```bash
docker run -d --name trtl3 -p 7713:7713 -e TOKEN=your_secret_token -e JOB_INTERVAL=5 nothiaki/trtl3:latest
```

So the service will be running on `http://localhost:7713/` and you can use by REST or use SDK's.

If you want to use docker compose you can add it on the file:

```yaml
services:

  trtl3:
    image: nothiaki/trtl3:latest
    ports:
      - 7713:7713
    environment:
      - TOKEN=your_token_here
      - JOB_INTERVAL=5
```
